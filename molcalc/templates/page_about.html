        <h1>What is MolCalc@ASU?</h1>

        <p>
          MolCalc@ASU is based on <a href="https://molcalc.org/">MolCalc</a>, a web-based
          chemistry teaching tool built originally by the
          <a href="propka.ki.ku.dk/~jhjensen">
            Jensen Group
          </a> at the University of
          Copenhagen and being extended by the
          <a href="https://biopchem.education/news/yarger-research-group/">
            Yarger Research Group
          </a>
          in the
          <a href="https://sms.asu.edu/">
            School of Molecular Sciences at Arizona State University
          </a>
          that allows chemists to build small molecules and estimate key molecular properties using
          research-grade quantum chemistry software. Currently, MolCalc@ASU can provide, in
          a matter of minutes or seconds, a decent sense of the physical and chemical properties
          of a chosen molecule, such as
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>energy-minimized molecular structure</li>
            <li>electronic structure and molecular orbitals</li>
            <li>thermochemical properties of the molecular gas form</li>
            <li>vibrational modes and their frequencies</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>Why do we need MolCalc@ASU?</h1>

        <p>
          <a href="https://molcalc.org/">MolCalc</a> was originally designed for teaching as
          opposed to research and, therefore, places an emphasis on running computations
          <em>quickly</em>. Indeed, so long as qualitative accuracy is sufficient, the speed of
          calculations if of primary importance since humans learn most effectively when
          real-time feedback is available. MolCalc@ASU is being developed in this spirit and
          is currently being stress-tested in the context of the upper-division
            <a href="https://biopchem.education/biopchem/courses/">CHM 343 lab course
            at ASU in Fall 2022</a>. However, the ASU MolCalc project has longer-term ambitions
            driven by the central goal to improve student engagement with fundamental concepts
            in chemistry and physics.
        </p>


        <h2>Emphasis on physical intuition</h2>

        <p>The broader ASU MolCalc effort is focused on leveraging computational methods
          to deeply integrate physical intuition with real or simulated experimental data using
          clickable explanations, dynamic visualizations, and interactive data. A guiding focus
          of our development efforts is to <i>make meaning transparent</i> using a web interface
          that provides explanations in a visual context, allowing the user to concentrate on
          concepts rather than deciphering complicated programs and arcane terminologies.
        </p>

        <h2>Cloud-based physics and chemistry</h2>

        <p>Like the original MolCalc project, ASU MolCalc will continue being developed as an
          open source interactive chemistry teaching tool. ASU MolCalc serves as the starting
          point for the development of a more comprehensive visual-centric interface for
          cloud-based physics and chemistry lab courses. The idea is to have students develop a
          "chemical intuition" about how molecular structure affects molecular properties, without
          performing the underlying calculations by hand (which would be near impossible for all
          but the simplest chemical systems). In particular, we envision developing a tool that
          establishes concrete conceptual pathways from representative experimental plots and
          data to the mechanistic physical/chemical picture that directly underlies that data.

        <h1>What technologies does MolCalc@ASU use?</h1>

        <p>MolCalc@ASU uses standard HTML and CSS3, along with the technologies and software
          packages described below.</p>

        <h2>Front-end components</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>JavaScript (<a href="https://jquery.com/">jQuery</a>)</li>
            <li><a href="http://jmol.sourceforge.net/">JSmol</a></li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Back-end components</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>Python (<a href="https://trypyramid.com/">(Pyramid</a>)</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.sqlalchemy.org/">SQLAlchemy</a></li>
            <li>JavaScript (<a href="https://jquery.com/">jQuery</a>)</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.msg.chem.iastate.edu/gamess/">GAMESS</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://www.faccts.de/orca/">Orca</a> (coming soon!)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How does MolCalc perform electronic structure calculations?</h2>

        <p>Great question! Currently, MolCalc currently uses
          <a href="https://www.msg.chem.iastate.edu/gamess/">The General Atomic and Molecular
              Electronic Structure System (GAMESS)</a>, which is maintained by the Gordon
          research group at Iowa State University. We are also in the process of incorporating
          <a href="https://www.faccts.de/orca/">Orca</a> as a user-selectable option for quantum
          chemistry calculation.
        </p>
